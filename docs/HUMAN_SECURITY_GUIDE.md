# Aegis CLI Human Security Guide

Aegis CLI helps teams run authorized, non-destructive security checks against services they own or are approved to test.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run catalog:generate
npm run aegis -- init
npm run aegis -- scope verify
npm run aegis -- plan --mode passive --target frontend
npm run aegis -- run --target frontend --mode passive
npm run aegis -- report --format html
```

## Authorization and Scope

`aegis.scope.json` is mandatory. It records project, environment, enabled targets, allowlisted hosts and paths, denied paths, authorization owner, proof type, expiry, and safety limits.

Production defaults to passive-only behavior. Active checks require a staging or development environment and must remain non-destructive.

## Frontend Testing

Frontend checks collect safe browser/runtime evidence such as headers, console errors, failed network summaries, screenshots, and DOM snapshots. Captured artifacts are stored under `.aegis/artifacts/frontend`.

## Backend/API Testing

API checks are selected from the safe catalog. Authenticated and role-matrix checks require explicit approval and dedicated test accounts.

## DB Read-only Audit

Database audit mode is limited to read-only configuration review. Write queries, schema mutation, and data dumps are blocked by policy.

## Supply Chain Scan

CI mode is designed for SAST, SCA, SBOM, container, IaC, and secret scanning integrations. This MVP records the selected checks and adapter readiness so teams can wire approved scanners later.

## Docker Usage

```bash
docker build -t aegis/security-cli .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" aegis/security-cli run --scope aegis.scope.json
```

## npm Usage

The package includes scripts such as `security:init`, `security:plan`, `security:frontend`, `security:api`, `security:ci`, and `security:report`.

## CI/CD Usage

Run `aegis scope verify`, `aegis plan --mode ci`, `aegis run --mode ci`, then publish SARIF with `aegis report --format sarif`.

## Reports and Remediation

Reports include scope, environment, scan configuration, findings by severity, artifacts, authenticated matrix placeholders, supply-chain readiness, DB audit readiness, and remediation guidance.
